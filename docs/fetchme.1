fetchme - Fast System Information Tool.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBfetchme\fP [ \fB<none>\fP ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Fetchme is a system information fetching utility created in C with the
purpose of being fast and POSIX-compliant, as well as written in C99.
The project gives enough information in the stock config for something
like a bug report for another project, or simply to show someone your
computer specifications.

.PP
There are Dependencies on Xlib, XRandr, and libpci if you use the
Resolution, Refresh Rate, or GPU detection modules respectfully.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Fetchme does not yet take arguments.
.PP
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
Fetchme is customized by creating editing the included config.mk
and (re)compiling the source. This allows modules to only be 
compiled and linked in only when they are selected in the configuration, 
eliminating dead code.
.SH "ISSUES"
.PP
Resolution, Refresh Rate, and GPU detection are all dependant on 
libraries that some users may not have, making these modules useless
for users that don't have X11, or don't have libpci.
